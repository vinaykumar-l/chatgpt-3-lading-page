Welcome to the ChatGPT-3 Landing Page repository! This project aims to showcase the capabilities and functionalities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-based language model, known as ChatGPT-3. The landing page is built using React, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with ChatGPT-3 and experience its natural language processing powers.

## Features

- **Real-time Responses:** Experience quick and responsive replies from the language model.
- **Customizable Prompts:** Tailor your conversational prompts to explore different use cases.
- **User-friendly Design:** The landing page is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing.
